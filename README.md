# The DirtyBird toolhead

![DirtyBird Toolhead](./docs/img/hero.jpg)

Developed as the successor of the Frankensherpa toolhead.

Like its predecessor, DirtyBird is designed to:

- Be lightweight, allowing greater acceleration and potentially improved resonance
- Have excellent cooling performance, with dual blower fans to improve overhang performance with many materials (including PLA)
- Have fans that are mounted low on the toolhead (cf. Afterburner) to improve resonance
- Allow for easy maintenance of the extruder
- Use a simplified carriage with integrated magprobe support
- Remain compatible with stock Voron (and Ramalama) idlers
- Support Roadkill-based chainless toolhead boards

Currently, DirtyBird supports the following extruders (and more via usermods):

- LGX mini
- Sherpa mini
- Sherpa micro

And the following hotends:

- Dragon
- NF Crazy
- Rapido (HF only, UHF not supported yet)

### BOM

[See BOM](./docs//bill-of-materials.md)

### Build Instructions

[See Build Instructions](./docs/build.md)

### Planned features

- MGN9 support (currently, the carriage fits MGN12 rails only)
- Filament sensor support (for Enraged Rabbit Carrot Feeder or other multi-material operation, under development)
- Integrated LED lighting (using Neopixels, currently experimental)
- Rapido hotend support (currently experimental)
- Cable chain mount (?)

### Known issues/to do list

- Potentially insufficient clearance between the Dragon core and the heater block of the Dragon hotend; as a result, the core may melt or otherwise cook, especially when using a silicone sock
  - Improvements have been made, but we are gathering feedback from real world usage.
- Rename files for version control/clarity (i.e. similar to Annex)
- Printed L/R marks for the fan ducts
